## Implementation of the gas and electricity price brakes.
For residential customers and small and medium-sized enterprises, the price brakes will be introduced on March 1, 2023 and will then provide retroactive relief as of January 1, 2023. This means that in March 2023 you will receive one-off individual relief retroactively for the months of January and February and ongoing relief from March onwards. We will, of course, provide our customers with all the information they need on specific implementation in good time before March 2023. There is still no need for them to take any action.
For customers with recording power metering (RLM) and an annual consumption of over 1.5 gigawatt hours (GWh), the gas price brake will come into force as early as January 1, 2023. From this delivery date, the respective bill will be reduced by the gas price brake. The gas price brake for customers with recording power metering and an annual consumption of less than 1.5 GWh and the electricity price brake will follow on March 1, 2023, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2023. This means that in March 2023, the corresponding customer groups will receive one-off relief retroactively for the months of January and February. From the delivery month of March, the price brakes will be offset against the respective bill. All our gas customers with recording power measurement will receive an information letter by mid-January to explain the details of the gas price brake.

## Price changes and their background
The situation on the energy markets is a historically exceptional situation that has never existed in this form before. Procurement prices for electricity and gas have multiplied in recent months. Even the slight price reductions we have seen in recent weeks are far above the price level before the energy crisis began. It is not possible at present to make a serious forecast about future developments. But how did the current price development come about? What is the government doing and what can you as a consumer do now?
We have compiled the background information for you in a compact form and give you tips on how to deal with the current situation.

Many energy suppliers that do not import gas, like E.ON, have a longer-term purchasing strategy for natural gas. This enables them to cushion short-term price fluctuations in energy purchases for customers. However, the situation on the energy markets has been very tense for months, leading to a sharp rise in procurement costs, which is now also hitting you as an end customer. Even the slight price reductions we have seen in recent weeks are far above the price level before the energy crisis began. Unfortunately, this means that consumers will have to brace themselves for further cost increases in the coming months, which the German government's relief measures will counteract. You can read more details on the background to the market situation further down this page.

## Government relief measures
The German government has initiated numerous measures in 2022 to ease the burden on citizens in Germany. On September 4, 2022, the government announced another extensive package of measures. To stabilize the energy market, laws and ordinances are also being introduced on an ongoing basis to respond to the current situation - but also to enshrine the financial relief for private households and companies in law.
To cushion the rise in energy costs in the longer term, the German government has introduced the gas price brake and the electricity price brake. Private households and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will thus receive relief as early as March 2023, with retroactive effect from January 2023. To bridge the gap until the price brakes come into force, the one-off payment by the state in December will cushion the expected higher heating costs this winter.
However, the financing of these measures, also known as a defense shield, to the tune of 200 billion euros has already been approved by the Bundestag on October 21, 2022. It goes without saying that we are implementing all the regulations in the interests of our customers.

### Current information on one-off payment and price brakes

- How does the gas price brake work?
To cushion the rise in energy costs in the longer term, the gas price brake will take effect from March 2023 for private households and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with retroactive effect from January 2023. For companies with recording power metering (RLM customers) and gas consumption of more than 1.5 million kWh, as well as licensed hospitals, the temporary relief will already take effect from January 2023. The gas price brake will initially apply until the end of December 2023 and can be extended by the German government until the end of April 2024.

This is how the gas price brake works: For a certain share of consumption, the state takes over the part of the energy price that is above 12 ct/kWh; for the other share, you pay the energy price contractually agreed with your energy supplier. The state compensates the difference between the 12 ct/kWh and the energy supplier's energy price.

- What is behind the electricity price brake?
In order to provide households and companies with longer-term cushioning from increased energy costs, the electricity price brake will apply from March 2023. Private households, small and medium-sized enterprises, and large companies with recording power metering will thus be relieved retroactively as of January 2023. The electricity price brake will initially apply until the end of December 2023 and can be extended by the German government until the end of April 2024.
This is how the electricity price brake works: For a defined share of consumption, the end consumer is relieved of electricity costs. For the other share, they pay the energy price contractually agreed with their energy supplier. The necessary financial resources come largely from the additional revenues of the electricity producers. This compensates for the difference between this and the energy supplier's energy price, which is due to the sharp rise in procurement costs. The relief amount is calculated depending on the annual consumption - either below or above 30,000 kWh per year.

- How does the implementation of Emergency Assistance December work?
Our customers will, of course, benefit from the one-time emergency financial assistance in December. We do not debit the December down payment. If you pay your budget billing amounts by bank transfer or standing order, you can suspend the December budget billing payment once. If you do pay the instalment, you will not suffer any disadvantage; we will simply offset the amount against the next annual bill.
The state will finance the December emergency aid. The money is intended to help cushion the expected higher gas and heating costs for consumers this winter - and is explicitly intended to cushion the more expensive prices. Saving energy is therefore still the order of the day. The more energy you save, the more money you have available for other things.
Legislators have also specified who receives the emergency aid: Residential customers as well as other consumers with a standard load profile. Certain customers with recording power metering (RLM customers) are also eligible for emergency assistance and must notify their energy supplier in order to benefit. Generally, eligible hospitals are not eligible; they are to receive separate relief. Nor does the emergency relief apply to customers who use natural gas for commercial power and heat generation.

- Is all my gas consumption for the month of December "free"?
No. For one thing, these are so far Commission proposals that are not yet applicable law. For another, the model provides that the month of September 2022 is the reference for the eliminated discount in December. December is thus not a "free month" for any gas consumption. We strongly recommend that you continue to pay attention to your energy consumption. For both financial and security of supply reasons, energy conservation continues to be the order of the day - every kilowatt hour saved counts.

- Will I get higher government assistance if I increase my budget billing now?
No, if you increase your deduction now, it will have no effect on any state relief. This is because the current proposal from the Expert Commission mentions September 2022 as the reference month for future relief. However, it is always a good idea to check your meter reading regularly. We recommend this to our customers as a matter of principle and even more so in view of the current price developments. By adjusting the budget billing, possible additional payments in the next annual bill can be prevented or at least mitigated. E.ON customers can easily adjust their budget online in the My E.ON service portal.

- Should I continue to save as much energy as possible now?
Yes - saving energy is still the order of the day. Every kilowatt-hour saved counts, both in terms of security of supply and from a financial perspective. The gas price brake for residential customers and small and medium-sized enterprises applies to 80 percent of consumption, above which customers must pay their normal prices in full. Unfortunately, there will be no relief for these prices for the time being due to the increased procurement costs of energy suppliers.

- Do I have to take action now?
No, at the current time there is no need for our customers to take action. The expert commission has only presented recommendations for easing the burden on gas customers in Germany, which will have to be fleshed out and adopted by policymakers in the next step.
However, we continue to recommend that, in addition to a conscious approach to energy, you review and adjust your budget billing in order to cushion the impact of the current situation for you. E.ON customers can find this information on the My E.ON service portal.

### Further measures
- When does the reduction in VAT on gas take effect?
In order to provide consumers with relief in view of the additional costs for gas, the German government has decided to temporarily reduce the value-added tax on gas consumption from 19 to seven percent. The tax cut to seven percent will apply temporarily from Oct. 1, 2022, to March 31, 2024.

- Who will receive the second heating cost subsidy?
In March 2022, a first heating cost subsidy was approved specifically for socially weaker households. The energy prices, which continue to be challenging for many, are now to be cushioned with a second heating cost allowance in order to relieve the burden on households that could not yet be included in the first heating cost allowance.

The heating cost subsidy will be paid to people who are eligible for at least one month's housing allowance in the period from September 1 to December 31, 2022. The amount of the heating subsidy is based on household size:
  - One-person households are entitled to 415 euros
  - Two-person households receive 540 euros
  - and 100 euros for each additional person in the household.
In addition, students and trainees who receive Bafög or vocational training assistance for at least one month in the period from September 1 to December 31, 2022, will receive a lump-sum subsidy of 345 euros.
The German government plans to pay out the allowance this year. For more information on the heating allowance, visit the federal government's website.

- When will pensioners receive the flat-rate energy allowance?
On Oct. 28, 2022, the one-time payment of 300 euros to pensioners was approved. According to the decision of the Bundesrat, people who are entitled to the lump sum on the cut-off date of December 1, 2022 will receive the lump sum:
  - to old-age, reduced earning capacity or survivors' pensions under the statutory pension insurance scheme
  - to pension benefits under the Civil Servants' Pension Act (Beamtenversorgungsgesetz)
  - to the first and second parts of the Soldiers' Pension Act (Soldatenversorgungsgesetz)
In addition, the person must be domiciled in Germany. The flat-rate energy payment should be made automatically at the beginning of December 2022 as a one-time payment by the pension paying agencies or the agencies paying pensions.

- How will the suspension of the EEG levy be implemented?
As of July 1, 2022, the statutory EEG surcharge on electricity was reduced from 3.723 cents per kWh (net) to 0 ct/kWh. E.ON automatically includes the savings of 3.723 cents per kWh (net) in the next electricity bill, for example.

## Information on energy saving measures according to § 9 EnSikuMaV
Germany must save energy. To this end, the German government has passed a new ordinance. Among other things, this obliges us as energy suppliers to inform you as our customers about your gas consumption and gas costs, as well as about possible savings potential in your apartments and houses (§ 9 EnSikuMaV - Short-term Energy Saving Measures Ordinance). It is intended to show you, the end consumer, the calculated savings potential if you continually reduce the average room temperature by 1 degree Celsius and, according to the assumptions of the ordinance, save 6 percent gas in the process.
If you would like to estimate your savings potential, you can use our calculation examples as a guide. For this purpose, we have calculated the costs and savings for typical consumption of different household sizes in a medium-sized German city using the example of Recklinghausen, with the following tariffs and basic prices:
Energy price of the gas supplier for the previous billing period: 5.87 ct/kWh (net) and 136.63 €/year base price (net).
Energy price in the future basic supply tariff (GV tariff) as of 30.9.2022*: 11.342 ct/kWh (net) as well as 185.25 €/year basic price (net)
*In accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance, we have used the basic supply tariff as of 30.09.2022 as the basis for the calculation examples.

### Note
Your individual energy prices and base prices may differ from the above energy prices depending on your region and provider. Likewise, your individual consumption may differ considerably from the average consumption of the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW) from the calculation examples if, for example, you also cook with gas or heat your hot water for showering and bathing with gas.

## Calculation example for a 1-person household:
For a 1-person household, we assume an apartment size of 40 sqm. According to BDEW calculations, this corresponds to an average annual gas consumption of 8,900 kWh. Calculated with the above gas prices, this results in the following costs and savings:
Costs previous year incl. basic price: 659.09 euros/year
Costs in GV tariff incl. basic price, price status: 30.09.2022: 1.194,69 Euro/year
Savings if heating temperature is reduced by 1° in euros, based on GV tariff: 60.57 euros/year
Savings by lowering the heating temperature by 1° in kWh: 534 kWh/year

## Calculation example for a 2-person household:
For a 2-person household, we assume an apartment size of 85 sqm. According to BDEW, this corresponds to an average annual gas consumption of 19,000 kWh. Calculated with the above gas prices, this results in the following costs and savings:
Costs previous year incl. basic price: 1,251.93 euros/year
Costs in GV tariff incl. basic price, price status: 30.09.2022: 2,340.23 Euro/year
Savings if heating temperature is reduced by 1° in euros, based on GV tariff: 129.29 euros/year
Savings by lowering the heating temperature by 1° in kWh: 1,140 kWh/year

## Calculation example for a 4-person household:
For a 4-person household, we assume an apartment size of 120 sqm. According to BDEW, this corresponds to an average annual gas consumption of 26,800 kWh. Calculated with the above gas prices, this results in the following costs and savings:
Costs previous year incl. basic price: 1,709.79 euros/year
Costs in GV tariff incl. basic price, price status: 30.09.2022: 3,224.91 Euro/year
Savings if heating temperature is reduced by 1° in euros, based on GV tariff: 182.38 euros/year
Savings when lowering the heating temperature by 1° in kWh: 1,608 kWh/year
