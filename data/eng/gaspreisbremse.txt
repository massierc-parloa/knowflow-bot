# Gas price brake
Find out here everything important about the gas price brake

## The most important at a glance
For private households, the gas price brake works as follows:
For 80% of your annual consumption forecast in September, you pay 12 ct/kWh (gross).
For every kilowatt hour above this, you pay the fixed energy price of your tariff.
The price brake only applies if your contractual energy price is above the 12 ct/kWh (gross). If the current energy price is below this, you pay the more favorable contractual conditions.
The gas price brake will be taken into account in your monthly budget billing starting in March 2023.
The months of January and February will be charged retroactively in March.
This also applies to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an annual consumption of less than 1.5 million kWh.
Different rules apply to companies with recording power metering (RLM customers) and a gas consumption of over 1.5 million kWh, as well as licensed hospitals.

## That's what's behind the gas price brake
The German government has launched the gas price brake to provide longer-term relief for private households and companies from rising energy costs. The gas price brake will apply from January 2023 and will be implemented for private households and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from March 2023. This means that for the months of January and February, they will be refunded the relief retroactively in March.
For companies with recording power metering (RLM customers) and a gas consumption of over 1.5 million kWh, as well as licensed hospitals, the temporary relief will take effect as early as January 2023. The gas price brake will initially apply until the end of December 2023 and can be extended by the German government until the end of April 2024.
In brief, the gas price brake works as follows: For a certain proportion of consumption - for private households and SMEs, this is 80% of their forecast annual consumption - the end consumer is relieved of gas costs. For all kilowatt hours above this, they pay the energy price contractually agreed with their energy supplier. The state compensates the difference between the 12 ct/kWh and the energy supplier's energy price. In addition, the gas price brake differentiates between private households and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as companies with registering power metering (RLM customers).
Whether small or large gas consumers, everyone benefits from saving energy: Because the less gas you use, the lower your consumption, which is above the government-imposed price brake, and the less you pay. So it is always worthwhile to reduce gas consumption to the extent necessary to stay within the government-paid gas price brake.

## Another hint
The price brake only takes effect if your contractual energy price is above the price cap. If your current energy price is below it, you will of course pay your more favorable contractual conditions.

## This is how the gas price brake for households and small and medium-sized enterprises works.
80 percent of the gas consumption forecast in September 2022 will be charged at the fixed reference price of 12 cents per kilowatt hour (gross). For each additional kilowatt hour (kWh) consumed, residential customers will pay the labor price contractually agreed with their energy supplier. This also applies to small and medium-sized enterprises whose gas consumption is less than 1.5 million kWh.
The procurement costs for natural gas have risen sharply, and sooner or later energy suppliers will have to take this into account in their tariffs. The gas price brake is intended to cushion these additional monthly costs for customers. In many cases, the price brake will therefore ensure that the monthly budget billing increase remains within a moderate range.
One thing in advance: As an E.ON customer, you don't have to worry about anything. We will take the gas price brake and the VAT reduction into account in your new budget billing amounts and inform you accordingly.
Companies with registering power metering (RLM customers) and a gas consumption of less than 1.5 million kWh will be informed in more detail by letter in January 2023.

## From when does the gas price brake apply?
The most important thing for you in advance: All residential customers of E.ON and all small and medium-sized commercial customers with a standard load profile do not need to do anything - we guarantee that we will implement the gas price brake in accordance with the law and automatically adjust your monthly deductions.
The gas price brake will be taken into account in your monthly deductions from March 2023. From that month on, you will pay the adjusted monthly budget billing amount. Since the gas price brake is retroactive to January 2023, these two months will be offset against your budget billing in March.

## This is how the gas price brake is calculated in detail
Normally, you pay a monthly budget billing for one-twelfth (1/12) of your projected annual consumption. For the gas price brake, your projected annual consumption in September 2022 is used and divided by 12 for the monthly budget billing. You will pay 12 ct/kWh (gross) for 80% of your monthly gas consumption. Above this, the contractually agreed energy price of your energy supplier applies for each additional kilowatt hour.
Your annual bill will then show your actual consumption. If you have consumed more than 80% of your predicted gas consumption, you will pay the contractually agreed price of your energy supplier for these kilowatt hours above this.
Keep in mind that the price cap only applies if your contracted energy price is above the price cap. Otherwise, of course, you pay the more favorable conditions of your contract.

## We'll use an example to show you exactly what this means:
For example, a 4-person household with an apartment size of 100 square meters has an annual gas consumption of 15,000 kWh, or 1,250 kWh per month. With an assumed old energy price of 8 ct/kWh, the household would previously have paid 100 euros/month. If the new energy price is 22 ct/kWh, for example, this household will pay 275 euros/month for its consumption in the future without the gas price brake. With the gas price brake, the amount is significantly lower, namely 175 euros/month. This is because 12 ct/kWh is paid for 80% of the forecast consumption, and only the consumption above this will incur the full cost of the energy price of 22 ct/kWh. The savings through the gas price brake thus amount to 100 euros per month.

Monthly gas consumption | 1,250 kWh | 15,000 kWh/12 = 1,250 kWh
80 % of monthly gas consumption | 1,000 kWh | 1,250 kWh x 0.8 = 1,000 kWh
20 % of monthly gas consumption | 250 kWh | 1.250 kWh x 0,2 = 250 kWh
Monthly costs before | 100 Euro | 1,250 kWh x 8 ct/kWh = 100 Euro
Monthly costs new without gas price break | 275 Euro | 1.250 kWh x 22 ct/kWh = 275 Euro
Monthly costs new with gas price brake | 175 Euro | 80 % at 12 ct/kWh: 1,000 kWh x 12 ct/kWh = 120 Euro and 20 % at 22 ct/kWh: 250 kWh x 22 ct/kWh = 55 Euro Results in a total of 120 Euro + 55 Euro = 175 Euro

## Good to know
The predicted annual consumption for gas in September 2022 may differ from the exact annual consumption in your last statement. This is because so-called weighting procedures have already been taken into account in your forecast annual consumption as of September 2022 - i.e., a comparison has been made between read consumption values and actual temperatures.

## This is how the gas price brake works for companies with recording power metering (RLM customers).
In order to provide relief from the high energy costs for companies with an annual consumption of more than 1.5 million kilowatt hours and registering performance measurement, as well as licensed hospitals, a gas price brake is also being introduced for them. It applies to around 25,000 companies and 1,900 licensed hospitals. Companies that use gas for commercial heat or power generation are exempt from the gas price brake.
The gas price brake for companies with recording power metering (RLM customers) and annual gas consumption of over 1.5 million kWh, as well as approved hospitals, will take effect from January 2023. Companies will then pay only 7 cents per kilowatt hour for 70% of their natural gas consumption, before network charges, metering point charges and government-initiated price components. For natural gas consumption above 70 %, the energy price agreed with the energy supplier will apply. The gas consumption of the year 2021 is used as the assessment basis for the 70 %.
For companies with registering power metering (RLM customers) and a gas consumption of less than 1.5 million kWh per year, the same price conditions apply as for customers with a standard load profile.
Important: We have informed all companies with registering performance measurement in more detail by cover letter in January 2023 and may need your support for fast and correct relief. For more details, visit eon.de/gaspricebremse-rlm.

## Gas and electricity price brake for companies: Observe limits under state aid law!
The total amount of relief is capped within a group of companies for all withdrawal points for legally determined aid. The maximum limits correspond to the specifications of the temporary crisis framework of the European Commission. The specifications for the maximum limits can be found in § 18 EWPBG and §§ 9 and 10 StromPBG.
