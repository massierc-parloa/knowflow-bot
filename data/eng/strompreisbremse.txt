# Electricity price brake
Find out here everything important about the electricity price brake

## The most important at a glance
For private households and companies with an annual consumption of up to 30,000 kWh, the electricity price brake works as follows:
For 80% of your current annual consumption forecast, you pay 40 ct/kWh (gross).
For each kilowatt hour above this, you pay the fixed energy price of your tariff.
The price brake only applies if your contractual energy price is above the 40 ct/kWh (gross). If the current energy price is below this, you pay the more favorable contractual conditions.
The electricity price brake will be taken into account in your monthly deductions from March 2023.
The months of January and February will be offset against your budget billing in March.
For customers whose electricity consumption is above 30,000 kWh, different rules apply.

## That's what's behind the electricity price brake
In order to provide longer-term relief from increased energy costs for private households as well as small, medium-sized and large companies with or without recording power metering, the German government has launched the electricity price brake. The electricity price brake will apply from January 2023 and will be implemented for most customers from March 2023. This means that they will be reimbursed retroactively in March for the months of January and February. The electricity price brake will initially apply until the end of December 2023, but can be extended by the German government until the end of April 2024.
In brief, the electricity price brake works as follows: For a defined share of consumption - in most cases 80% of the previous year's consumption - the end consumer is relieved of electricity costs. For the other portion, the consumer pays the energy price contractually agreed with his or her energy supplier. The necessary financial resources come largely from the additional revenue generated by the electricity producers. This compensates for the difference between this and the energy supplier's energy price, which is due to the sharp rise in procurement costs. The relief amount is calculated depending on the annual consumption - either below or above 30,000 kWh per year.
But regardless of whether you are a small or large electricity consumer, it is worthwhile for everyone to save energy: Because the less electricity you consume, the smaller the share of your consumption that the state has not capped. that is above the state-imposed price brake, and the less you pay. So it always pays to reduce your electricity consumption enough to stay within the government paid price brakes.

## This is how the electricity price brake works up to an annual consumption of 30,000 kWh
80 percent of electricity consumption is charged at the fixed reference price of 40 cents per kilowatt hour (gross). For each additional kilowatt hour (kWh) consumed, household customers pay the labor price contractually agreed with their energy supplier. This also applies to heating electricity customers and companies whose annual electricity consumption is less than 30,000 kWh.
As the procurement costs for electricity have risen sharply over the course of the year, energy suppliers have to take this into account in their tariffs sooner or later. The electricity price brake cushions the resulting additional monthly costs for customers. In many cases, it will therefore ensure that any monthly budget billing increase remains within moderate limits.
One thing in advance: As an E.ON customer, you don't have to worry about anything. We will take the electricity price brake into account in your new deductions and inform you. Companies with recording power measurement (RLM customers) will be informed in more detail by letter.

## From when does the electricity price brake apply?
The most important thing for you in advance: All residential customers of E.ON and all small and medium-sized commercial customers with a standard load profile do not need to do anything - we guarantee that we will implement the electricity price brake in accordance with the law and automatically adjust your monthly deductions. Companies with registering power metering (RLM customers) will be informed in more detail by letter.
The electricity price brake will be taken into account in your monthly deductions from March 2023. From that month on, you will pay the adjusted monthly budget billing amount. Since the electricity price brake applies retroactively to January 2023, these two months will be offset against your budget billing in March.

## This is how the electricity price brake is calculated in detail.
For the electricity price brake, your consumption forecast is used and divided by 12 for the monthly budget billing. You then pay 40 ct/kWh (gross) for 80% of your monthly electricity consumption. Above this, the contractually agreed energy price of your energy supplier applies for each additional kilowatt hour. Your annual bill will then show your actual consumption.
We will use an example to show you exactly what this means:
A 4-person household with an apartment size of 100 square meters consumes 4,500 kWh of electricity per year, or 375 kWh per month. With an assumed old energy price of 30 ct/kWh, the household used to pay just over 110 euros/month. If the new energy price is 55 ct/kWh, for example, this household will pay around 206 euros/month for its consumption in the future without the relief provided by the electricity price brake.
With the electricity price brake, the amount is significantly lower, namely 161 euros/month - because 40 ct/kWh (gross) is paid for 80% of consumption, and only the consumption above this will incur the full cost of the energy price of 55 ct/kWh.
The relief provided by the electricity price brake thus amounts to 45 euros per month.

Monthly electricity consumption | 4,500 kWh/12 = 375 kWh | 80 % of monthly electricity consumption
375 kWh x 0.8 = 300 kWh | 20 % of monthly electricity consumption | 375 kWh x 0.2 = 75 kWh
Monthly costs up to now | 375 kWh x 30 ct/kWh = 112,50 Euro | Monthly costs new without electricity price brake
375 kWh x 55 ct/kWh = 206,25 Euro | Monthly costs new with electricity price brake | 80 % at 40 ct/kWh: 300 kWh x 40 ct/kWh = 120 Euro and 20 % at 55 ct/kWh: 75 kWh x 55 ct/kWh = 41,25 Euro Results together 120 Euro + 41,25 Euro = 161,25 Euro

## Good to know
The amount of relief you get from the electricity price brake depends on
- how much you consumed in the last billing period,
- how much you are consuming in the current billing period and
- how high your contractually agreed energy price is.
One more note: If you have agreed with your energy supplier on a lower energy price than the price brake, you will of course pay your contractually agreed more favorable conditions. The price brake only takes effect if your contractual energy price is higher than the price cap.

## This is how the electricity price brake works for annual electricity consumption above 30,000 kWh.
End consumers as well as medium and large companies with an annual consumption of over 30,000 kilowatt hours are also relieved of the high energy costs by the electricity price brake. For electricity consumption above 30,000 kWh, the following relief applies: For 70 % of consumption, consumers pay 13 cents per kilowatt hour before network charges, metering point charges and government-imposed price components, including value-added tax. For electricity consumption above 70 %, the energy price agreed with the energy supplier applies.
What does the 70 % consumption refer to?
For consumption points that are supplied via standardized load profiles (such as household customers, but also companies), the 70 % consumption of the electricity price brake is based on the consumption forecast. For offtake points that are not supplied via standardized load profiles, the 70% consumption is determined on the basis of metered consumption in 2021.

## Note for companies and facilities with withdrawal points with recording power measurement (RLM).
In the Electricity Price Brake Act, a distinction is made between two relief models, irrespective of the voltage level and the metering method. Only the consumption (less than / greater than 30,000 kWh) from the calendar year 2021 is relevant.
We will assign your RLM exit point to a model on the basis of the consumption data available to us. As a rule, there is no need for action on your part, i.e. registration or login is not necessary.
However, in a few exceptional cases, we need your assistance to grant your relief amount correctly and quickly. You can find out what these are here.

## Gas and electricity price brake for companies: Observe limits under state aid law!
The total amount of relief is capped within a group of companies for all withdrawal points for legally determined aid. The maximum limits correspond to the specifications of the temporary crisis framework of the European Commission. The specifications for the maximum limits can be found in § 18 EWPBG and §§ 9 and 10 StromPBG.
Please ensure compliance with the requirements under state aid law. If the maximum limits applicable to you are likely to be exceeded, please notify us immediately for gas via eon.de/gaspreisbremse-rlm or for electricity by 28.02.2023 at the latest via eon.de/strompreisbremse-rlm.
Please understand that we are not permitted to provide legal advice.
